# Candy Machine Overview

The Candy Machine, or CM for short, is a [Solana Program](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview) designed to reliably sell one NFT a time.

The Candy Machine progam behaves like a real-world mechanical candy machine, where a person expects to put a coin into the machine and get one item out of it, with the usual exceptions. eg: it won't take your coin if it's out of candy.
