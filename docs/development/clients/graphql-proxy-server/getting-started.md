# Getting started

Graphql cache server receives all the Mataplex data from the blockchain and keeps it in cache, and gives data through GraphQL interface in a convenient form, based on the Metaplex data usage.

There are 2 types of caches right now.
- [InMemory](/development/clients/graphql-proxy-server/in-memory-cache)
- [MongoDB cache layer](/development/clients/graphql-proxy-server/mongo-db-cache)
